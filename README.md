An Educational Platform Empowering The Underserved


Introduction

Simply Cryptocurrency aims to educate, empower and engage with the masses by creating a digital video hub that is cultivated for the sake of catering to minorities. The purpose of Simply Cryptocurrency is to aid in bringing about mass adoption of cryptocurrency technologies as a whole by educating, empowering and engaging with communities.

Problem


Lack of Educational Structures

The decentralized world of cryptocurrency is hungry for growth yet it can only take place if mass adoption is a reality. Mass adoption will only occur if the market at large deems a crypto project or tool as useful and they understand it. Many blockchain companies are creating technology but forgetting about education, which will empower those who use technology to understand. 


Lack of Financial Literacy

During the time of 2017 when Bitcoin went mainstream, there were reports of people mortgaging their homes to get in on the bull run. When the market crashed in 2018, many lost everything. I believe that having an understanding of centralized financial concepts will only aid in having a greater understanding of decentralized concepts. Many companies in the cryptocurrency space are missing this.


Lack of Swift Application 

There are many projects that aim to be the most technical and Simply Cryptocurrency does not want to be that because what is revered in the communities of the cyberpunks is dust under the feet of the masses. People will not care about cryptocurrency until cryptocurrency is positioned to aid the masses. 


Lack of Representation

In times like these, it’s easy to see that minorities are more user than owner or producer. We wish to change the narrative by empowering our own. Upon value being communicated in a way that is not above them but right on the level with where they are, minorities are loyal subscribers, patrons and customers. On top of all of this, they benefit most from blockchain technology yet are the furthest from it. Simply Cryptocurrency desires to change all of this. With this in mind, Simply Cryptocurrency will not ostracize its platform to exclusively people of color.


Our utility token known as the “Simply Crypto” token will be used to view content in our educational platform and exchangeable with other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and more. Our audience will learn then be able to apply what knowledge they have learned on the decentralized side. Our educational hub will be a place that will be free to the masses but premium content, decentralized and centralized in the realm of financial literacy, will be only accessible by way of the Simply Crypto token. The educational hub’s business model would be based on ad revenue, 15 second commercials within the free video content. The capital would be used for business expenses as well as job creation within the community in fields such as video editing, filming, graphic design, and photography. With job creation, swift application, financial literacy and educational structures, Simply Cryptocurrency will measure success not solely by exchanges but by the most important metrics, real world impact based on our educational tools.


The Simply Crypto token (PCTO) is an ERC-20 token. ERC20 tokens are built on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC is short for Ethereum Request for Comments. The 20 stands for the unique proposal ID number that separates the ERC20 platform from others based on the rules its protocol adheres to. ERC-20 tokens do not have any transfer restrictions and therefore can be freely traded by anyone. The smart contract was customized by Christopher Perceptions and deployed via MyWish.io as a way for those who use Simply Cryptocurrency to be able to easily trace the creation source.


The ERC20 token is the standard on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the greatest benefits to the Simply Crypto token being an ERC20 token is enhanced liquidity, a myriad of options for exchanges and storage options as many exchanges accept ERC20 tokens as well as being able to store the Simply Crypto token in a myriad of digital wallets. This means every PCTO holder will be able to reduce the risk of theft. 


PCTO has a total supply of 100,000,000,000 and it will run natively on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. 4,000,000,000 PCTO tokens will be offered via an airdrop from May 21st - August 21st, 2020. The starting price for PCTO on an exchange is $0.59. The goal is to offer the Simply Crypto token on three exchanges before the end of 2021.

The Simply Crypto token roadmap takes place in three phases. 


Phase I - Offer of Donation, Airdrop, Tithe & Development (2020)

Simply Cryptocurrency will focus on educating, empowering and engaging our community and will leverage the utility token, PCTO, which will power our digital education hub that will launch Q2 of 2021. The PCTO token will be available for bonuses between May 21st, 2020 and August 21st, 2020. For early users who purchase Simply Crypto educational courses, they will receive 100,000 PCTO tokens as long as they have proof of purchase. A social airdrop as well as a bounty will be available. While the PCTO is offered, development will continue to further refine the output of its vision. The goal as it relates to exchanges is to have PCTO placed on at least one reputable and safe exchange before August 21st, 2020. Lastly, the “Tithe” portion of the entire token fund, which means “a tenth”, will be given to LIV Village, a South African village for orphan and vulnerable children, to aid in educational development regarding cryptocurrency. The “Tithe” portion from the development budget will go toward American programs and organizations that are based in minority communities for the sake of aiding in educational development regarding cryptocurrency. American recipients will be announced on August 21st, 2020.


Phase II - Content Creation & Expansion (2021)

Job creation will take place as qualified translators (who speak Mandarin, Zulu, Spanish and French) as well as high quality film makers / editors for content creation will be needed. Upon exchange placement, the PCTO token will expand in media presence, potential holders and users of the Simply Crypto platform.


Phase III - Platform Launch (2021 - 2022) ( + )

No later than Q2 of 2021, the educational hub of Simply Crypto will launch on mobile app stores and as a web app for free. The platform will offer premium courses as well as leverage ad revenue to keep costs low, with the hopes of completely eliminating cost for users other than for premium courses. PCTO token holders will receive special incentives, discounts and free materials. The goal is to scale the user base of Simply Crypto to 1,000,000 by the end of 2021, based on aggressive marketing and partnerships with coding labs, companies and inner city community programs throughout various markets in the United States as well as far abroad, starting with expansion in South Africa.


Market

The market of e-learning has amazing statistics that are estimated to have grown due to the world becoming more technology reliant as COVID19 has placed the world on pause. For starters, the worldwide e-learning market is projected to be worth $325 Billion in 2025. 98% of US corporations plan to incorporate e-learning by 2020. E-learning has a low barrier of entry due to less cost for the facilitators which directly affects students who may not be financially able to purchase books, supplies, etc. All that is needed is a device that can connect to the internet and they are able to learn from anywhere, at their own pace. Also, e-learning increases learning retention rates by between 25% and 60%. 49% of students worldwide stated they had taken an online course in the preceding 12 months. Along with this, the self-paced online learning market in the US is estimated to be worth $15.86 billion in 2021. Not to mention, minorities in America have a desire to learn, especially about cryptocurrency. College-educated Black Americans are nearly twice as interested as college-educated White Americans in learning more about crypto and the majority of Black Americans believe tech will have a positive impact on society. People of color in America have the same needs as people of color on a global scale; everyone wants to know how to scale from where they are to where they want to be and cryptocurrency is a tool that can aid them in getting to their dreams of a life where they are financially in control of their own destiny. Gamification and microlearning will be coupled together with our unique go to market strategy as we curate content for our users via web apps and mobile applications.
